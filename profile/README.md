# Scarab Sign: Next-Generation NFT Trading Infrastructure 🦗

Welcome to Scarab Sign, where we're reimagining NFT marketplace architecture through the power of multiplayer metatransactions and advanced cryptographic primitives. Our platform represents a fundamental shift in how digital assets can be traded, offering a gasless, escrow-free environment that prioritizes efficiency without compromising security.

## Vision 🔮

Scarab Sign embodies the true spirit of blockchain scaling through social coordination. While many focus on technical scaling solutions, we recognize that Satoshi's vision encompassed a broader perspective: the power of signed messages to enable efficient, trustless interactions. Our platform demonstrates this by leveraging the SNIP-12 standard to create a new paradigm in NFT trading.

## Core Technology 🛠️

At the heart of Scarab Sign lies our innovative multiplayer metatransaction system. This architecture allows us to:

- Transform multiple individual bids into unified, efficient on-chain transactions
- Eliminate gas fees for bidders through sophisticated signature aggregation
- Remove escrow requirements while maintaining robust security guarantees
- Enable future privacy-preserving features through Pedersen hash properties

### How It Works

Our system orchestrates a sophisticated yet elegant auction process:

1. Auctioneers initiate sales by broadcasting signed SNIP-12 messages through our pubsub queue
2. Bidders participate by submitting signed messages containing their bids
3. Our system aggregates these signatures into a single, efficient transaction
4. Smart contracts validate and execute trades atomically

This process dramatically reduces blockchain congestion while maintaining the security and finality guarantees that users expect.

## Technical Stack 📚

### Frontend Infrastructure
- React with Vite for blazing-fast development
- starknet-react for seamless blockchain integration
- Braavos wallet integration for secure transaction signing

### Backend Components
- snforge: Comprehensive testing framework
- starkli: Robust contract deployment and interaction
- Websockets server for real-time auction coordination (transitioning to IPFS)

### Smart Contracts
Our contracts leverage the SNIP-12 standard to enable:
- Secure message signing and verification
- Efficient signature aggregation
- Robust nonce management
- Future privacy-preserving features

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- docker for frontend development
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Rust toolchain for contract development
- Cairo compiler
- Starkli CLI tools

```
## Contributing 🤝

We welcome contributions from the community! Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details on our code of conduct and development process.

### Areas for Contribution

We're particularly interested in contributions in these areas:
- Implementation of browser-to-browser IPFS pubsub
- Enhancement of anonymous bidding mechanisms
- Optimization of signature aggregation
- Improvements to the auction mechanism
- Documentation and testing

## Roadmap 🗺️

### Short-term Goals
- Replace websocket server with IPFS pubsub over WebRTC
- Implement basic reputation system
- Enhance real-time auction monitoring

### Long-term Vision
- Deploy anonymous bid aggregation using Pedersen hash properties
- Establish cross-chain NFT trading capabilities
- Develop institutional-grade auction mechanisms

## Security 🔒

Security is our top priority. While our architecture eliminates traditional escrow risks, we maintain robust security through:
- Comprehensive signature verification
- Atomic execution of trades
- Rigorous nonce management
- Regular security audits

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@scarabsign.com.
